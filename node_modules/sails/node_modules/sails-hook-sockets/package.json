While the \"patch\" version (i.e. the \"Z\" in \"X.Y.Z\") will normally differ from that of Sails core, the \"minor\" version number (i.e. the \"Y\" in \"X.Y.Z\") of this hook is also the minor version of Sails for which it is designed.  For instance, if a hook is version `0.11.9`, it is designed for Sails `^0.11.0` (that means it'll work from 0.11.0 all the way up until 0.12.0).\n\n#### Does this hook use Socket.io v1.0?\n\nYes.\n\n#### Are there changes?\n\nYes, see the [v0.11 migration guide](http://sailsjs.org/#/documentation/concepts/Upgrading). You probably won't need to change anything unless you were extensively using the old Socket.io v0.9 configuration.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
